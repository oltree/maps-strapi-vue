# Project Description

This project is a full-fledged application that is divided into two parts: backend and frontend. The backend is built on the Strapi framework and includes a "plot" table, which represents a land plot with a level and a set of points forming a geolocation. The frontend, in turn, is developed based on Vue and implements the display of added land plots on a map using Mapbox.

The main functionality of the application is the ability to add new land plots to the map using a simple interface. Each land plot is represented by a set of points that can be represented by coordinates (latitude and longitude). If a land plot has a square shape, it can be represented by four points forming a closed geometry.

The map used in the application is implemented using Mapbox, which provides high accuracy in displaying geodata and extensive options for customizing the visual display of the map.
